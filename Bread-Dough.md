Bread Dough
============

//Exceptionnally this recipe is in English because if you start doing it you are
going to have to share it with all your friends :).

(based on the recipe in French here: http://www.tillthecat.com/2013/05/recette-de-baguette-de-pain-maison/).

Active preparation time: 10 minutes
Passive preparation time: 2-3 hours
Cooking time: 30-45 minutes (depending on oven)




For 4 baguettes:

Ingr√©dients
-----------

- 500g of all purpose flour (we took the unbleached king arthur)
- 11g of salt
- 8g of fast rise yeast (the one we found in kroeger here works the best so far)
- 400g of lukewarm water

Extensions:
- 15g of brown sesame


Preparation
-----------

* dilute the yeast in some of the water (I usually start with 100g
of water). It is important that the yeast is well dissolved.
* add the rest of the water
* mix together the flour and salt in a salad bowl, add the watery yeast mix (if
you want to put sesame, now is the time)
* with a wooden spoon, mix. It does not have to be fast or during a long time.
Just mix it like a cake dough.
* cover with a wet cloth and let it rest for at least 2 hours (not
in the fridge).

[pause]

* get it out of the dish, cut in four so that it gives the form of a baguette
* let it rest while the oven is preheating (we found that 460F was nice without
convection, ours here has convection, 450 seems enough)
* during preheating (and cooking), put a pan in the oven with water in it so
that the interior of the oven has high humidity
* put some flour on top of each baguettes (it will give a sexy "old-fashioned
look")
* before putting in the oven, do some cuts on top of the baguettes with scissors
* cook for 30 minutes (with convection, generally we let it 40/45 minutes
without convection), until the baguettes have a nice golden touch.



Remarks
----------

Bread freezes well. You can freeze any left-over, then put it in a toaster then
eat it at breakfeast with salted butter!
